# Heart LED PCB

<p align="justify">A collection of <b>Valentine's Day-themed PCB designs</b> featuring LED animations in the shape of a heart. Perfect for pendants or keyrings!</p>

## Main Branch

<p align="justify">The main branch features a design built around the <b>ICM7555</b> timer IC, configured in astable operation mode. The timer output drives a <b>CD4017B</b> decade counter, which sequences through LEDs to create an animated pattern. Power is supplied by a <b>CR2032</b> 3 V battery through a <b>TPS6122</b> boost converter.</p>

### Components Overview

#### ICM7555IBAZ-T

<p align="justify">The ICM7555 is a CMOS RC timer that provides significantly improved performance over the standard SE/NE 555/556 and 355 timers. It is a direct replacement for these devices in most applications. Enhanced features include low supply current (<i>60 μA</i>), a wide operating supply voltage range (<i>2V to 18V</i>), higher frequency performance, and no requirement to decouple the Control Voltage pin for stable operation.</p> 

<p align="justify">Although the ICM7555 itself consumes very little current, the total system supply current can increase unless high-impedance timing components are used. To address this, a high value for R and a low value for C were selected.</p> 

<p align="justify">The frequency of the astable operation is determined by the formula:</p> 

<div align="center">
	
$`f=\frac{1}{RC}`$

</div>

<p align="justify">To achieve a period of approximately one second, R was set to <i>100 kΩ</i> and C to <i>4.7 μF</i>.</p>

</p>

#### CD4017BM96

<p align="justify">The CD4017B is a decade counter with 10 decoded outputs. Each output remains high for the duration of one full clock cycle, sequentially cycling through the outputs with each clock pulse. It operates over a wide supply voltage range of <i>3V to 18V</i>, making it compatible with various applications.</p>

#### TPS61222DCKR

<p align="justify">The TPS6122x family devices provide a power-supply solution for products powered by single-cell, two-cell, or three-cell alkaline, NiCd, or NiMH batteries, or a single-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer battery. They offer up to 95% efficiency under typical operating conditions.</p>

<p align="justify">In this design, the specific application of the device is a fixed output voltage supply of <i>5 V at up to 60 mA</i>. The TPS61222 DC/DC converter is suitable for systems powered by a total typical input voltage between 0.7 V and 5.5 V.</p>

<p align="justify">In the fixed-voltage version, the output is set by an internal resistor divider. To ensure proper operation, a suitable inductor must be connected between pin VIN and pin L. Inductor values of <i>4.7 μH</i> provide good performance across the full input and output voltage range. Using inductor values below 2.2 μH is not recommended.</p>

<p align="justify">An input capacitor with a value of at least <i>10 μF</i> is recommended to improve the transient behavior of the regulator and reduce EMI in the total power supply circuit. A ceramic capacitor placed as close as possible to the VIN and GND pins of the IC is advised.</p>

<p align="justify">For the output capacitor (C2), small ceramic capacitors are recommended, placed as close as possible to the VOUT and GND pins of the IC. A minimum capacitance value of 4.7 μF should be used; <i>10 μF</i> is preferred.</p>

## HT7750A Branch

<p align="justify">In this branch, the TPS61222DCKR converter is replaced by the <b>HT7750A</b>. The HT77XXA series is a family of step-up DC/DC converters known for their high efficiency and low ripple. These converters feature an extremely low start-up voltage and high output voltage accuracy. They require only three external components to provide a fixed output voltage of 2.7 V, 3.0 V, 3.3 V, or <i>5.0 V</i>.</p>

## MCU Branch

<p align="justify">This branch replaces the timer and decade counter with an <b>ATtiny816</b> microcontroller. The ATtiny816 is a member of the tinyAVR® 1-series family featuring advanced analog features and core independent peripherals. This design allows for more sophisticated LED control and animations through programmable patterns.</p>

<p align="justify">Programming is accomplished via the Unified Program and Debug Interface (<i>UPDI</i>), a one-wire interface for external programming and debugging. The circuit incorporates a tactile button connected to a GPIO pin for user interaction.</p>

## Simple NE555 Branch

<p align="justify">Finally, this branch replaces the ICM7555 timer IC with a conventional <b>NE555</b>, offering a cost-effective alternative that requires only one SMD component - the IC itself. This design imitates a popular DIY kit, where the NE555 generates a <i>1 Hz signal</i> at pin 3, alternating between high and low levels. When pin 3 is low, the upper row of LEDs illuminates, and when high, the bottom row lights up instead, creating an appealing visual effect.</p>

<p align="justify">While the circuit can operate with a CR2032 3V battery, one LED row will appear dimmer due to the NE555's minimum voltage requirements. For optimal brightness across both rows, a 5V power supply connector can be soldered to the board as an alternative power source.</p>
